# rock-paper-scissors
This game was created with only a javascript file that writes output to the browser console. It uses no GUI.
The index.html file is only used to host the link to the app.js file that runs the game.
The program was adapted to use a GUI with buttons to make the choices and to have the scores
and running total displayed.
